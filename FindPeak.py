# Question 1  - Find peek

# In an array of numbers say a 'peak' is defined as a number that is greater than or equal to 
# its neighbors. For example, in the array [1, 4, 7, 3, 4, 4, 5] the peaks are 7, 4 (only the 
# one following the 3), and 5. Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns a
# peak (any of the peaks is fine). Follow up: Can you design an algorithm that would take 
# sub-linear time?

# [1, 4, 7, 3, 4, 4, 5]
#           m

# 1) is Peak?
# 2) if search the half that is larger than current value.
 
# [2, 3] 
# def findPeek():


# You are given an array of integers that was sorted then rotated an unknown number of times.* 
# Search the array for a given integer, returning any index that matches. 
# *Example: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 (started out as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then was rotated twice)
