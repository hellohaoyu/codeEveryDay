# You have a stream of numbers coming in (Let's say 1 million), the numbers are between [0, 999), 
# implement a class which could can insert(int i), getMean(), getMedian() in constant time


#[0, 999)

# array[int]
# sum
# sum/2
# => get Median


# currentMean * N*1.0/(N+1) + *1/(N+1)  


# 1,2,3,4,5  6+6+3 = 15/5 => 3 => 3

# Soft delete -> improve efficiency
# Build-in cache -> configuriable cache in service
# Namespace -> server (special tunning for different area)
# Make fields optional (save space)
# 1 milliion requestion per second -> Bottle neck? What's the bottleneck?

# batching -> process request in batch!!!
# client side batching / server side batching
# Performance vs consistency -> consistency is more important?
